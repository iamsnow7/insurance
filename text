    THE INTRO  In this chapter, the main application is designed and tested. Atom Text Editor is used for all the writing of the codes for the actual design as well as GOOGLE Chrome is used to see the designs output and also for optimizing the design performance with simulations and analyses.
      GOOGLE chrome browser’s development tool is used for all debugging process. This browser was choses due to its powerful tools for debugging. Results are monitored and all findings described. Implementing the work strategy, the chapter went through the following stages:
      •	Design Set-Up and Simulation
      •	Method of Analysis
      •	Result and Discussions


      4.1 DESIGN SET-UP AND SIMULATION
      In the coding process, the application required a number of pages namely, the admin-order page, admin-products page, product-form page, login page, home page, check out page etc.
      Each of these pages has its own working file (HTML FILE).
      In angular, to start a new project, the “ng new component” is used on the command line interface. Also to create an HTML File, the “ng g component” is used on the command line interface. Each component introduced has its own typescript, html and css file.
